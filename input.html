  <p id="123">Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, 
liquids, and/or gases at the same time. This can occur when the sample is 
composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were 
a liquid because it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter 
can also have properties of more than one state when it is a mixture, such 
as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are 
actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or 
solid).</p>

   Identify each of the underlined items as a part of either the 
macroscopic domain, the microscopic domain, or the symbolic domain of 
chemistry. For any in the symbolic domain, indicate whether they are 
symbols for a macroscopic or a microscopic feature.
